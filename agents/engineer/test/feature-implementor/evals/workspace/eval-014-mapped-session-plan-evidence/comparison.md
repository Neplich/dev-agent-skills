## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reads_mapped_docs_first` | PASS | with_skill trace shows change-map resolution, then reads docs/site/api/session.md before broader repository exploration. |
| `verifies_against_code` | PASS | The checkpoint and trace cite src/session/config.txt as 30 minutes, identify the mapped document's 60-minute conflict, and preserve that impact in the planning gap packet. |
| `treats_unverified_as_low_trust` | PASS | The output explicitly marks last_verified_version: unverified as low trust and bases the timeout/conflict judgment on src/session/config.txt and repository searches. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2f129ddb28e1f1e80d9edd6a2ff9482f3bf6168c9099228d14be2ebcaee2b61a; fixture_sha256=ebf98490e96d51646bb08c2897d26dd073cad98267ddc69d86f17d77581f2927; output_sha256=57846bdfb35cbc45e4b5b59295c6148a8d48626b432f99e2d30816c243f423d9; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Resolved the mapped documentation, verified the code conflict, treated the document as unverified, and blocked implementation pending missing PRD/TRD alignment.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2f129ddb28e1f1e80d9edd6a2ff9482f3bf6168c9099228d14be2ebcaee2b61a; fixture_sha256=ebf98490e96d51646bb08c2897d26dd073cad98267ddc69d86f17d77581f2927; output_sha256=f29d2564c74d91d44dd61ff21e7f1ca5bd9171c14b19dcd0ac868378f1922ac2; snapshot_sha256=80f9a693880a89b38b5b530453b92991fb12049a0347c0cbdcae15b79e1e5570
- Behavior: Changed configuration and documentation despite the unverified documentation conflict, without demonstrating the required mapped-document-first planning gate.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
