## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `writes_repair_plan` | PASS | With-skill output lists the target file, minimal change, and both validation commands. |
| `records_fix_split_decision` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states that implementation/validation sub-agent split is unnecessary. |
| `waits_for_plan_confirmation` | PASS | With-skill output asks the user to confirm the repair plan before modifying files or running validation. |
| `e2e_handoff_requires_confirmed_plan` | PASS | The plan records PRD/TRD alignment, target files, validation commands, the suggested docs/qa/e2e/notifications directory, and defers E2E updates until confirmation and repair completion. |
| `does_not_apply_fix` | PASS | The locked snapshot is empty and git evidence shows no changes; the output only proposes changes after confirmation and does not claim to have applied or verified a fix. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=665db040735beea5cd9a54d5fea883336b5acadf81472985dbcc094ec677dd55; fixture_sha256=cb0f3c3b3299f6d7c5c59f8e23f6486f0ceb71f6128a3055fbac267527c0d07e; output_sha256=ec7bcc9e589ee2a81393df7a1de01501145a3942b7cfe99d1c8b18b283522d81; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a read-only, reviewable repair plan, explicitly gates implementation on confirmation, and records the E2E handoff conditions.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=665db040735beea5cd9a54d5fea883336b5acadf81472985dbcc094ec677dd55; fixture_sha256=cb0f3c3b3299f6d7c5c59f8e23f6486f0ceb71f6128a3055fbac267527c0d07e; output_sha256=d7498635f49c4bdacfccee75274418f19b49f56a4032bc6c57e40549ca06c405; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a useful diagnosis and repair suggestion but does not record the required split decision, confirmation gate, or E2E handoff requirements.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
