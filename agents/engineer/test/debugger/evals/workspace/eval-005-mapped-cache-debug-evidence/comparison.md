## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reads_mapped_docs_first` | PASS | Raw trace shows the with_skill lane read the change map, then its matched docs/site/api/cache.md, without reading unrelated formal documents. |
| `verifies_against_code` | PASS | The delivered report identifies ttl_seconds: 60, compares it with the documented 300 seconds, quantifies the 240-second discrepancy, and qualifies the runtime conclusion because no implementation code exists. |
| `treats_unverified_as_low_trust` | PASS | The report explicitly notes both documents are marked unverified, sets expected behavior to unaligned, separates observed facts from inference, and makes the root-cause conclusion conditional on runtime consumption. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=f67ee52e742cb8b8fa4a2e4a8def50688400c24b6328050c434ae918f3f4101b; fixture_sha256=5265284c4bc9506c9aff21630151842110054255967ea23b3c9669fa67c6063d; output_sha256=0e67c7c03dcc09e0fecbc10bc193cab7f510e66ba346d9794d03815ece9a904d; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Produced a structured, read-only diagnosis grounded in the TTL fixture and mapped documentation, with appropriate uncertainty and no mutation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=f67ee52e742cb8b8fa4a2e4a8def50688400c24b6328050c434ae918f3f4101b; fixture_sha256=5265284c4bc9506c9aff21630151842110054255967ea23b3c9669fa67c6063d; output_sha256=a973d6416bd95abd9c8f57528a11729dde45336eec5d6bd89981c660dc4b8be1; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline also identified the TTL discrepancy, but did not explicitly frame the unverified documentation as low-trust or structure the diagnosis with the same qualification.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
