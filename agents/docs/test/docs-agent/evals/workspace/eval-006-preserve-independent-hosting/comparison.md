## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `preserves_not_applicable_evidence` | PASS | With-skill output records N/A applicability, cites both source paths, identifies public/internal variants, and assigns follow-up to the formal-docs-sync/repository-maintainer release path. |
| `does_not_open_devops_handoff` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly says no application deployment-team intervention, no configuration change, deployment, or downstream flow; locked git evidence shows no mutations. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=75b11cec554fb9cabf92f38559abd7d5bd8c24a6e4b7927952fa49a44fb00e8c; fixture_sha256=f6c421284ed0143d28fff161f0f4c1cd48b067505beae1d38677d871a066543f; output_sha256=e0ecba9a1a6b22d8db117d0a7040394ffba463d4c87d7b292ee8ffac94df7f93; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly preserves the valid static-hosting decision and avoids an unnecessary deployment handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=75b11cec554fb9cabf92f38559abd7d5bd8c24a6e4b7927952fa49a44fb00e8c; fixture_sha256=f6c421284ed0143d28fff161f0f4c1cd48b067505beae1d38677d871a066543f; output_sha256=f6c164e2a39af4bb01a919fa67cf654865e7e16f44c5dec2b8d65201bfc28a3e; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Also reaches the correct no-intervention conclusion, but provides less structured applicability, evidence, and ownership detail.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
