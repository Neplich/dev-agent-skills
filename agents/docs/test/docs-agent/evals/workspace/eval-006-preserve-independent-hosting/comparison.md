## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `preserves_not_applicable_evidence` | FAIL | with_skill confirms static hosting, public/internal variants, evidence path, and Web Platform ownership, but does not explicitly report the decision as not_applicable or state that the maintainer-confirmed alternative remains valid. |
| `does_not_open_devops_handoff` | PASS | with_skill concludes application deployment need not intervene and routes the missing workflow inputs to documentation publishing/Web Platform, not a repo-wide deployment handoff; the decision is treated as valid. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=75b11cec554fb9cabf92f38559abd7d5bd8c24a6e4b7927952fa49a44fb00e8c; fixture_sha256=f6c421284ed0143d28fff161f0f4c1cd48b067505beae1d38677d871a066543f; output_sha256=b9ebe837f1be6d9c2fef0128191b40410c6e438559ea4c3665503350ef1f28e1; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly avoids application deployment involvement, identifies the static workflow and variants, and routes the blocking issue to documentation publishing/Web Platform.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=75b11cec554fb9cabf92f38559abd7d5bd8c24a6e4b7927952fa49a44fb00e8c; fixture_sha256=f6c421284ed0143d28fff161f0f4c1cd48b067505beae1d38677d871a066543f; output_sha256=43d130813ef67da433dbcf349f28db0a87e2211d85316bd508cd510a79aa4c87; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly avoids application deployment involvement and notes missing workflow inputs, but routes ownership less precisely and omits formal not_applicable framing.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- preserves_not_applicable_evidence: missing explicit not_applicable status and explicit confirmation that the maintainer-approved alternative hosting remains valid.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- Only this durable comparison retains the reviewable conclusion and superseded history.

Overall result: PASS

## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `preserves_not_applicable_evidence` | PASS | With-skill output confirms static artifact hosting rather than application-image delivery, cites hosting/decision-record.md and .github/workflows/publish-docs-static.yml, identifies public and internal variants, and names Web Platform as the owner for future hosting changes. |
| `does_not_open_devops_handoff` | PASS | With-skill output concludes application deployment team intervention is unnecessary, says the matter can be closed, and does not create a repo-wide deployment handoff. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=75b11cec554fb9cabf92f38559abd7d5bd8c24a6e4b7927952fa49a44fb00e8c; fixture_sha256=f6c421284ed0143d28fff161f0f4c1cd48b067505beae1d38677d871a066543f; output_sha256=3f6400e43bfb8a9c5d8adf9b29a460511e5c35cb06104543f70a88d6f0cab741; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Uses the decision record and workflow to preserve the valid alternative-hosting decision, identify owners and variants, and close without deployment-team handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=75b11cec554fb9cabf92f38559abd7d5bd8c24a6e4b7927952fa49a44fb00e8c; fixture_sha256=f6c421284ed0143d28fff161f0f4c1cd48b067505beae1d38677d871a066543f; output_sha256=97af8259f07cc2a5e986b6fab955d423a3f18d94d58c4acdbfcc9eb30d9af7f0; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly concludes application deployment intervention is unnecessary, but incorrectly introduces an unsupported blocker about missing docs/site and upload-script files.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- Only this durable comparison retains the reviewable conclusion and superseded history.

## Historical Context (Superseded)

# Issue #246 Migration Status

## Current Result

- Evidence status: **STALE**
- Migration status: **PENDING**
- Blocking reason: this eval has not yet been rerun under the Issue #246 scenario, lane-isolation, and fresh-judge contract.
Overall result: BLOCKED

## Historical Context (Superseded)

The complete pre-migration comparison follows unchanged. It is retained only as historical context and is not current release evidence.

# Skill Eval Comparison

## Evaluation Target

- Skill: `docs-agent`
- Eval: `eval-006-preserve-independent-hosting`
- Review context: issue #162 fresh paired validation

## Test Set / Fixture Version

- Fixture: issue #162 scenario evidence in this workspace
- Validation date: 2026-07-22
- Execution cleanup: all declared runtime paths were absent from pristine scratch fixtures

## Latest Result

- Overall result: PASS
- Blocking reason: 已按 #238 完成 fresh 隔离重跑（2026-08-06，gpt-5.6-luna + effort medium，独立 judge 判定），结论基于新契约；历史行为描述保留于下方段落（适用旧契约）。

## #238 Fresh Rerun Result（2026-08-06）

- 执行：with/without 两条 lane（独立 codex exec，gpt-5.6-luna + effort medium，仓库外 workspace 物化，逐字同 prompt）；判定：独立 judge（fresh 会话，read-only，对照断言逐条核对产物事实，不采信 lane 自述）
- with_skill：Behavior `PASS` / Coverage `FULL`
- without_skill：Behavior `FAIL` / Coverage `FULL`

### 逐断言判定

| 断言 | with_skill | without_skill | 判定依据 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| preserves_not_applicable_evidence | PASS | FAIL | with_skill 的 `docs/site/DEPLOYMENT.md` 明确写出 `not_applicable`，引用 `../../evidence.md`，覆盖 Public/Internal 两个变体，并说明变化时进入 PM → DevOps → Docs 路由；without_skill 仅描述“不引入图片存储依赖”，未明确 `not_applicable`、证据路径或下一 owner。 |
| does_not_open_devops_handoff | PASS | PASS | with_skill 明确写出“DevOps handoff: not required”，仅在托管模型变化时重新路由；without_skill 也未生成 DevOps handoff，且当前证据确认静态托管仍有效。 |

未满足断言（with/without 任一 FAIL）：`preserves_not_applicable_evidence`



## With-Skill Behavior
> ⚠️ 本节为该文件历史轮结论（适用旧契约/旧 fixture），本轮 #238 结论见上方「#238 Fresh Rerun Result」。

- 保留 not_applicable、证据、Public/Internal、维护者决定和下一 owner，有效时不生成 DevOps handoff。
- Candidate source: fresh `tmp/eval-runs/issue-162/with_skill/eval-006-preserve-independent-hosting/candidate-output.md`.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

> ⚠️ 本节为历史轮执行证据（适用旧 run）；当前结论以本文件上方「#238 Fresh Rerun Result」为准。

- PARTIAL (1/2)；保留独立托管决定但未使用稳定 not_applicable 状态。
- The same prompt and pristine fixture were used; no historical baseline, target skill, Agent README, shared skill-map, old comparison, or with-skill output was used to compose it.

## Failures
> ⚠️ 本节为该文件历史轮结论（适用旧契约/旧 fixture），本轮 #238 结论见上方「#238 Fresh Rerun Result」。

- baseline 缺少稳定跨角色状态。
- No with-skill assertion failure or runner/credential blocker.

## Next Steps

- Keep this regression case; strengthen fixture ambiguity later where the baseline already passes.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Runtime candidates, copied fixtures, verdict, status, and diagnostics remain under `tmp/eval-runs/issue-162/` and are not committed.
- Only this durable comparison, eval definition, metadata, and fixture evidence are submitted.
