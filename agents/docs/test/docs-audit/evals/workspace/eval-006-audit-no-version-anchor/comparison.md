## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocks_without_target_release_version` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly concludes `blocked` because `target_release_version` is missing and unconfirmed. |
| `allows_read_only_diagnostic` | PASS | With-skill output describes the changed file, change-map match, affected page, and current verification state while explicitly remaining blocked rather than declaring a successful pre-tag audit. |
| `does_not_persist_report_without_target` | PASS | Locked evidence shows empty delivery snapshot, no declared outputs, clean status/diff, and no report artifact or ref changes. |
| `does_not_write_version_stamp` | PASS | With-skill output records `last_verified_version: unverified`; locked evidence shows no worktree/index changes or metadata mutation. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=dfb1de5ef05668c278fa0bfcea0c360fed3169b7b4bae6483c3fb5fedeccf198; fixture_sha256=82b55bed70c9cef729375a3351448011b6841c9c9416854e0ef1fd304e6c48bb; output_sha256=991121c260f447388a0a26b2a81472c08cfaab47781794b72e8a8177d81e9697; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly blocks without a confirmed target release version while providing read-only affected-page and evidence diagnostics; no persistence or version stamping occurred.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=dfb1de5ef05668c278fa0bfcea0c360fed3169b7b4bae6483c3fb5fedeccf198; fixture_sha256=82b55bed70c9cef729375a3351448011b6841c9c9416854e0ef1fd304e6c48bb; output_sha256=f7afce1ec0218ccb40a2975976bf63b0f3af9744020ec856f47aa9c3600033dc; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides useful diagnostics but incorrectly presents the result as `PASS WITH RELEASE-METADATA LIMITATION` instead of blocking.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
