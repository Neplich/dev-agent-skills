## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `includes_doc_only_change` | PASS | With-skill output identifies `docs/site/api/catalog.md` as the changed and required document in the impact scope despite reporting no code changes. |
| `uses_related_code_for_fact_check` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly cites `related_code` resolution to `src/catalog/routes.txt` and uses its route contents as code evidence for both API checks. |
| `classifies_doc_only_conflict_mismatch` | PASS | With-skill output preserves the DELETE declaration, reports only GET in `src/catalog/routes.txt`, includes document/code evidence and impact, and classifies the result as `mismatch`. |
| `blocks_despite_no_code_diff` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly reports pre-tag result `blocked`, says stamping was not performed, and provides no `ready_for_tag` result. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=59ccd7c8df4ada989871eac608af9fe615691e1a2d925c63deac93d4d7d56264; fixture_sha256=126b82b218c4429d9a8e50c428008903893e0b48fd89e0ee4186368ab968404a; output_sha256=975e1f2e364e0b3e40c4dc91ba3059217a8735dfa49cd3de682c1080933dd285; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly audits the documentation-only change, follows related code, classifies the unsupported DELETE endpoint as mismatch, and blocks pre-tag release.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=59ccd7c8df4ada989871eac608af9fe615691e1a2d925c63deac93d4d7d56264; fixture_sha256=126b82b218c4429d9a8e50c428008903893e0b48fd89e0ee4186368ab968404a; output_sha256=c1eadabc2aae7694c0808d1fdd88e4218ed00d659896a930b1efb8d5d3710606; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline identifies the documentation/code conflict and advises against release, but does not express the full structured impact, mismatch, and pre-tag blocking behavior.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
