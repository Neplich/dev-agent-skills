## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assertion_1` | PASS | With_skill explicitly says not to write a PRD or code and instead enters product discovery. |
| `assertion_2` | PASS | With_skill presents one focused decision point with three concrete options and asks the user to choose before continuing. |
| `assertion_3` | NOT_EXERCISED | The direction is not yet stable; the candidate correctly waits for user confirmation before any PRD or downstream documentation action. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=0af25e0d51f2fb040654e6f1d54a6ad79ea082de53fb485f0d81b3fe8a3d6ee6; fixture_sha256=a4faa6eb1bc545a0fcd2b0f3491c8b376050fe70e6b532b62cd5d45f16655b85; output_sha256=e87b23f0198a7ccf0e10366b6aa1b33515f22a8c07ea5908a713f03328580f8c; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: The lane performed focused greenfield discovery, avoided premature documentation, and paused for the required user decision.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=0af25e0d51f2fb040654e6f1d54a6ad79ea082de53fb485f0d81b3fe8a3d6ee6; fixture_sha256=a4faa6eb1bc545a0fcd2b0f3491c8b376050fe70e6b532b62cd5d45f16655b85; output_sha256=5bdc610260e961c60e060d355c0e64fd248c8c435b5417de8f03c3501949e87b; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: The baseline avoided a PRD but asked six broad questions at once and proposed an unconfirmed product hypothesis.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Await the user's choice of the first product direction, then continue discovery and recommend documentation only after the direction stabilizes.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
