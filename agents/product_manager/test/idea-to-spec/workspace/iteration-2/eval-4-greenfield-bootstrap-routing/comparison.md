## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assertion_1` | PASS | with_skill explicitly reports an empty workspace, pending tech stack, and no existing docs before asking a product-direction question. |
| `pm_first_lane` | PASS | with_skill explicitly identifies the lane as `greenfield-discovery`, equivalent to the required PM-first new-project discovery path. |
| `pm_first` | PASS | with_skill stays in PM discovery, does not run scaffolding commands, and directs the flow toward PRD/DECISIONS after confirmation. |
| `assertion_4` | PASS | with_skill recommends forming a PRD skeleton and decision record, with durable documentation paths listed as pending. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=47f636262c26b6b99c860d59ef8342eebebbd60397f192a193020f82c13fa42c; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=07ad031463d1a02999d61744584cdef4b87ec65e5c674a26d7b2beb3ee0ae855; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly performs empty-workspace discovery, selects the PM-first greenfield lane, avoids project initialization, and identifies PRD/DECISIONS as the next documentation step.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=47f636262c26b6b99c860d59ef8342eebebbd60397f192a193020f82c13fa42c; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=785d840d004d9f2276caf1d08245bde78a07bd51f4488bf9a3ca050ec1c33e93; snapshot_sha256=aa872f0629d272b58322b8752e946196678d342410e8a531f6fc7cf9ec5385d0
- Behavior: Creates a PRD and avoids initialization, but does not provide the explicit empty-workspace state or greenfield-discovery lane framing shown by with_skill.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Confirm the assistant's target-user direction before writing the pending PRD and DECISIONS documents.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
