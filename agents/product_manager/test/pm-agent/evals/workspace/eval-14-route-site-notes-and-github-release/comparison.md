## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routes_site_notes_to_docs_specialist` | PASS | With-skill routing decision explicitly selects `docs-agent:release-notes-gen` for the requested site release notes. |
| `routes_github_release_to_pm_specialist` | NOT_EXERCISED | The PM GitHub Release stage is blocked by missing runtime capability, so this later routing step is not exercised. |
| `preserves_release_sequence` | NOT_EXERCISED | The output records site-first sequencing as required, but no ready handoff, Docs gates, or release audit evidence is produced because execution is blocked. |
| `does_not_use_old_pm_skill_name` | PASS | The PM owner is not named `release-notes-gen`; the output names `docs-agent:release-notes-gen` as the downstream Docs specialist. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=aeb9d94911e2f21a05aec636eb7871f30e1f918271687f3e921766aab4cdc3f2; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=58d552206fb5af95533dd73acf539a6765f12dc72957ab878e1ffdd43b4ebb6b; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly selects the Docs specialist and preserves the site-first boundary, but stops before the PM Release stage because required capabilities and source evidence are unavailable.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=aeb9d94911e2f21a05aec636eb7871f30e1f918271687f3e921766aab4cdc3f2; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=8bb3305a2db29083491536bf68c3ebe1ea686642c60ccbcdd74acd58a27d25fa; snapshot_sha256=ec43c795f403cdaedc59295e8d12ec4da8d823d501a4ed41186e262cf97a5fa1
- Behavior: Creates site notes and a GitHub Release preview without routing or specialist handoff, using unconfirmed placeholders.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the missing release-source evidence and enable the Docs and PM GitHub Release capabilities to exercise the remaining stages.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
