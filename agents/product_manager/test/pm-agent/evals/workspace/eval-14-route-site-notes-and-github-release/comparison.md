## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routes_site_notes_to_docs_specialist` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly selects `docs-agent:release-notes-gen` for the site release notes and does not select PM or changelog routing. |
| `routes_github_release_to_pm_specialist` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sequences the work through PM `github-release-gen` for the GitHub Release preview and says that specialist is unavailable; it does not have Docs execute the GitHub step. |
| `preserves_release_sequence` | NOT_EXERCISED | The output states the site Release Notes → Docs audit → GitHub Release preview sequence, but the later ready-handoff and release-audit consumption cannot occur because the required specialists and runtime evidence are unavailable. |
| `does_not_use_old_pm_skill_name` | PASS | The PM owner is named `github-release-gen`, while `release-notes-gen` is used only for `docs-agent`; no old PM naming is used. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=aeb9d94911e2f21a05aec636eb7871f30e1f918271687f3e921766aab4cdc3f2; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=7bf19f3fb99a51298de6a124aaaaec6f0096461932d16e71d8c3987374b94240; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes site notes to Docs, identifies PM github-release-gen for the GitHub preview, preserves the intended site-first sequence, and stops at the missing-capability/evidence boundary.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=aeb9d94911e2f21a05aec636eb7871f30e1f918271687f3e921766aab4cdc3f2; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=9d7df698a9357ac2970f761a7b3ddb6e51d5c3b19c71d2f347e0ceb5bc4b7f98; snapshot_sha256=c86c9a60a8c2c612958372e299839b3991855f3239b244e8b060e75c8952c888
- Behavior: Created conservative site notes and a GitHub preview without demonstrating specialist routing or release sequencing.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide v1.0.0 change evidence and enable the Docs and PM release specialists before continuing.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
