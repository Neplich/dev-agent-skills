## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hotfix_direct_path_only` | PASS | With-skill output limits the change to the login-page empty-state copy, forbids scope expansion, and requests only the missing project files and target wording. |
| `evidence_still_required` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states that source and validation entry points are missing, that direct checks cannot currently run, and what minimum inputs are needed. |
| `no_full_suite_required` | PASS | With-skill output does not require an unrelated full E2E suite or any other broad test gate. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=c1eed8e1c9ea187a63f5d2607cb2b7b56fd52e56864a1562adb4fa15208a2bbf; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly blocked safely on the empty fixture, preserved the narrow requested scope, and requested the minimum missing inputs without claiming implementation or verification.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=ab8f81ef0d267a93a821632f7c409b5d9272e57a3f7bad6e45b833ad12e2fbe4; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Also correctly recognized the empty repository and requested project files; it provided less explicit scope and verification-boundary detail.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the project files and exact replacement copy, then run the focused login-page verification.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
