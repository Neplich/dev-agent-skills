## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hotfix_direct_path_only` | NOT_EXERCISED | With_skill classified the request as standard and rejected hotfix handling, but no QA/E2E path guidance was exercised before the required target copy was provided. |
| `evidence_still_required` | NOT_EXERCISED | With_skill explicitly required confirmation before implementation and verification, so verification evidence, results, and blocked checks were not yet exercisable. |
| `no_full_suite_required` | NOT_EXERCISED | With_skill had not reached test planning or execution; the standard-tier routing was recorded, but full-suite policy was not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=7336368d80244041f8ab355de2c61468c6fd7df883c5e0b15e6e306950c21843; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly identified missing target copy and absent source/docs, refused to modify or claim verification, and requested clarification.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=3ab1cfaae6759947e045c6f38c16c547b4a2186dcf85d88bf41682eb0eb82d88; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Reported the empty repository and stopped without attempting a change or verification.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the exact replacement copy, then implement and verify the scoped change.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
