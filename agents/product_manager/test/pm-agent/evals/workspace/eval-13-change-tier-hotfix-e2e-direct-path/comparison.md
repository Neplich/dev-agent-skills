## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hotfix_direct_path_only` | NOT_EXERCISED | With-skill output stopped at the missing-source/documentation blocker before any QA/E2E workflow or hotfix coverage decision could be exercised. |
| `evidence_still_required` | NOT_EXERCISED | With-skill output stopped before implementation or verification; no verification stage was reached. |
| `no_full_suite_required` | NOT_EXERCISED | With-skill output stopped before test execution; full-suite policy was not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=87b2281ff713c9a657844c2f64342d1e34ad8c27b205bcd0f8a0d086a32acac6; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Safely inspected and reported the empty workspace, made no unsupported changes or verification claims, and requested the missing project inputs.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=6aa9338af255a235b2cdcbe931d17dd842234b9c1da5646854e83f9553a2c216; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Reported the empty repository and inability to modify or verify the requested login-page copy.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the actual project source and relevant expected-copy or acceptance documentation, then implement and run the focused verification workflow.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
