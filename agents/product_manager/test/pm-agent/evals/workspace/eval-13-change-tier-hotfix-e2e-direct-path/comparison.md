## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hotfix_direct_path_only` | PASS | With-skill output keeps the scope to login-page empty-state copy, names non-goals, and requests only the missing copy or source basis. |
| `evidence_still_required` | NOT_EXERCISED | No executable target was available; the candidate states implementation and targeted verification must wait for the required input. |
| `no_full_suite_required` | PASS | Neither the output nor trace requires an unrelated full E2E suite. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=601a610c5680197103c3b33edcce21deb1b1ae469ba7ffdeb8f1377b1402ede1; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly preserves the narrow scope and pauses for missing implementation input before modification and verification.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=4b716f413649b163f4dd5dcd45dc5b4214bafbb5cb059afb757fef3a77b94653; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=a47f360a563e18fa3d84bbca202010a58a35b84ee3667142f18423be3c02acb2; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline correctly identifies the git-only workspace and requests project source.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the login-page source/target file and approved replacement copy or its authoritative requirement; then perform the targeted change and verification.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
