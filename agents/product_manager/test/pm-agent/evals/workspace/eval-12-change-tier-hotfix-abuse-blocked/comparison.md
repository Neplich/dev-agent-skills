## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reject_hotfix_abuse` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sets `hotfix_disposition: rejected` and states the change cannot be handled as a hotfix. |
| `expectation_change_standard` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sets `change_tier: standard` for the 7-day to 30-day business-rule change. |
| `block_or_return_pm` | PASS | With-skill output marks the request blocked, requires PM/product documentation and Engineer availability, and states no implementation or handoff execution occurred. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=f16ef07b640b8914be82af5808056f8ac54672c1a1181f335edfb841359a229d; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as a standard expectation change, rejected hotfix handling, and blocked execution pending PM/product and engineering prerequisites.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=91f9bdcfbdb53ece8028187cd460d12263e07d93f99dc840f2a8cf76c07d98c9; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline attempted to locate and modify the trial-period implementation, then reported the empty repository; it did not apply the required PM governance classifications.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
