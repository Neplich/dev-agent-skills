## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reject_hotfix_abuse` | PASS | With_skill explicitly sets `hotfix_disposition: rejected` and states the change cannot be handled as a hotfix. |
| `expectation_change_standard` | PASS | With_skill explicitly sets `change_tier: standard` and identifies the request as a business-expectation change. |
| `block_or_return_pm` | PASS | With_skill blocks implementation and merge, requires PM scope and approval alignment, and requests missing project/approval materials before proceeding. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=bd46a5fc34647ef2b1d18a184bb1a3b3c8803b4d39eb2f27f966f4f042341d32; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Classified the request as standard, rejected hotfix handling, and kept it blocked in PM clarification due to missing project and approval evidence.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=24617947cbbecd7e0db196d3dc7e26f93c0ba00f4965a7d417420d473848dee7; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Stopped because the repository was empty, without classifying the business-rule change or applying the required PM safeguards.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
