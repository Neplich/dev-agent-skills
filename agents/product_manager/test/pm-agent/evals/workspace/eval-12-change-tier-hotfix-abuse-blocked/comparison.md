## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reject_hotfix_abuse` | PASS | with_skill output explicitly sets `hotfix_disposition: rejected` and states the request is a product rule change. |
| `expectation_change_standard` | PASS | with_skill output explicitly sets `change_tier: standard` and describes the 7-day to 30-day change as a product-rule/expectation change. |
| `block_or_return_pm` | PASS | with_skill output sets `entry_basis: blocked`, routes to `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, requires confirmation, and explicitly prohibits direct code, testing, commit, or merge work. Locked git evidence shows no mutation. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=b4d800e4161a274008cd798730f5659ee7133cc8fe0cef1a5f9254f9f160cd9e; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly rejected hotfix handling, classified the change as standard, and blocked implementation pending PM scope and expectation confirmation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=0787ae4dd9b575bbf47ce17d2e3acce6290cd02f9d7e7ebffd64fae329fe932a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Reported the empty repository and inability to proceed, but did not classify the request or provide the required PM safety disposition.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
