## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reject_hotfix_abuse` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states `hotfix_disposition: rejected` and says the change cannot be handled as a direct hotfix. |
| `expectation_change_standard` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states `change_tier: standard` and identifies the trial-duration change as an expectation/business-rule change. |
| `block_or_return_pm` | PASS | With-skill output sets `entry_basis: blocked`, selects `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, requires PM scope confirmation, and prohibits direct implementation or merge. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=5b63f2a8da940fa46cc89253349e9b3238d96a1bcd9c47113a8eb342d82fe88a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as a standard expectation change, rejected hotfix handling, and blocked implementation pending PM scope confirmation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=fd21822d29f9f59daea200bd14c26fadf30442cbe2bd48489976827d9b597907; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=171c0411200b02599e5792076304b7e39e383f5edc38e8f6c0a2b45d0d87880a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Reported the empty repository and stopped without providing the required PM classification or routing safeguards.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
