## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_deployment` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sets `request_type: deployment`. |
| `repo_wide_scope_allowed` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly uses `feature_path: N/A`, `feature: N/A`, and `feature_path_evidence: []` for repository-wide work. |
| `devops_handoff_packet` | NOT_EXERCISED | The workflow stops before DevOps handoff because environment, release scope, rollback requirements, and runtime context are missing; the later handoff assertion is therefore not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=983f48de7c87e8858ea7b53d30882ad9bff26c0d10a622eeaa7416baa584c326; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as deployment, permitted repository-wide N/A scope, and paused before DevOps handoff pending missing operational context.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=87697149ff413904b4705bb8bc456bc2cb87806676538990c969d7236d24928f; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Baseline inspected the empty repository but did not provide deployment classification or routing context.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the missing environment, release scope, rollback requirements, and related operational context before completing the DevOps handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
