## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_deployment` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly classifies the request as `request_type: deployment`. |
| `repo_wide_scope_allowed` | PASS | With-skill packet uses `feature_path: N/A`, `feature: N/A`, `parent_feature: N/A`, `feature_level: N/A`, and `feature_path_evidence: []` for repository-wide CI work. |
| `devops_handoff_packet` | NOT_EXERCISED | The candidate blocks the DevOps handoff pending environment, release scope, and rollback information, so the later handoff assertion is not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=fb0abd91b53c46be23b9744a223f78e90ebf77736da251a360a188913f2ab6dd; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the repository-wide CI and release-readiness request to deployment, applies N/A feature scope, and stops before an unready DevOps handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=3922ade662011f4b332129184db83250ec3047a13b04aa9135b718c66bcf9d1b; snapshot_sha256=50c094fd83f1741825d33f44273f686128d8f0d3d3012f5a0c203b9b50db162f
- Behavior: Creates CI/preflight files and reports the empty repository as blocked, but provides no deployment classification or handoff packet.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Confirm the target environment, release scope, rollback needs, and risks.
- Next: Install or make available devops-agent, then complete the handoff packet.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
