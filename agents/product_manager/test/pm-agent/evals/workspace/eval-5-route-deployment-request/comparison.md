## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_deployment` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly sets `request_type: deployment` for CI and pre-release readiness work. |
| `repo_wide_scope_allowed` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly uses `feature_path: N/A`, `feature: N/A`, and `feature_path_evidence: []` for repository-level work. |
| `devops_handoff_packet` | PASS | Before the `DevOps handoff`, with_skill records the operational scope, unresolved environment and release/rollback details, required rollback output, and risks/blockers in the routing and handoff packet. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=99ba4ad7cd06fd1895c071e82e69ab0586cad96f4073097914f04ae5544dcb45; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as deployment, allowed repository-wide N/A scope, and produced a blocked DevOps handoff packet with relevant context and risks.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=03a97e53c8cba09156724c0748eebfe06f60f2867096b119448ddc1a8dcd5f0e; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline recognized the repository was empty but did not classify or route the deployment request or produce a DevOps handoff packet.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
