## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_deployment` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sets `request_type: deployment`. |
| `repo_wide_scope_allowed` | PASS | With-skill output uses `feature_path: N/A`, `feature: N/A`, `parent_feature: N/A`, `feature_level: N/A`, and `feature_path_evidence: []` for repository-level CI and pre-release work. |
| `devops_handoff_packet` | PASS | Before the blocked DevOps route, the output records the repository CI/pre-release goal and scope, required CI/readiness/rollback deliverables, unavailable runtime/deployment/release/rollback criteria, and explicit risks; it does not claim downstream execution occurred. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=fe6f7414228cef572c24461ca15017031665b7d3b313f21ee4fdd1279919cd06; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Classified the request as deployment, allowed repository-wide N/A scope, and produced a guarded DevOps handoff packet before stopping at the unavailable downstream owner.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=df8dd8d18e0b79f0114ea9e750efb47af7d21bc05b6ea3666cff7d6bae4802fe; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=f310096871164c4864f17f396c18c5e8f002350528437a8373a678f281da7a06; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Inspected the empty repository and stopped with a generic request for project and deployment details without PM classification or a structured handoff packet.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Install or provide devops-agent.
- Next: Provide the project runtime, CI platform, deployment environment, release criteria, and rollback expectations.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
