## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_security` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly classifies the request as `request_type: security`. |
| `security_scope_first` | PASS | With-skill output records risk_surface, assets, permissions, data_flow, and remediation_expectations before the downstream route, including in the locked Routing decision block. |
| `security_handoff` | NOT_EXERCISED | Security handoff is not exercised: the output identifies `security-agent` as the selected owner but explicitly states the handoff is blocked because required project evidence and the Security capability are missing. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=36e2dc52efc02bd4a536346d8f3cd5d27459a1a97e6287cf5969afca708442f1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=352226d00b2224618a8c7fca914b3a08f32f4de094edffd92c82f9c9c8b1f6b9; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classifies the request, records the required security scope first, and safely stops before an unavailable Security handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=36e2dc52efc02bd4a536346d8f3cd5d27459a1a97e6287cf5969afca708442f1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=dc9799b009a6c59f47a6831e750baa800409eb155c69df913e4b47f4c7ed912a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a useful empty-repository security assessment but does not classify the request, record structured security scope, or route to Security.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the missing project and runtime evidence, then complete the Security handoff with the recorded scope and required output.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
