## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_security` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly classifies the request as `request_type: security`. |
| `security_scope_first` | PASS | With-skill trace and output record risk surface, assets, permissions, data flow, and remediation expectations before repository inspection and before the blocked downstream handoff. |
| `security_handoff` | NOT_EXERCISED | The candidate selects `security-agent` and includes scope and required output, but explicitly reports the formal handoff is blocked because `security-agent` is unavailable; the actual handoff is therefore not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=36e2dc52efc02bd4a536346d8f3cd5d27459a1a97e6287cf5969afca708442f1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=e0860e09b3694688cf27f3902e8c8dffd5864735d1176f618ee3487d54f22920; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the request to security, records the required security scope, and identifies the blocked Security handoff with its scope and required output.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=36e2dc52efc02bd4a536346d8f3cd5d27459a1a97e6287cf5969afca708442f1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=6ba1641a02e6a9c2580d84e6988435ac2ed2ed93c2574e0bc1e060b533769290; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a read-only empty-repository audit, but does not classify the request as security or perform the required scope-first Security routing.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Install or enable security-agent, then complete the Security handoff and audit.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
