## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_design_or_update` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly classifies the request as `request_type: existing_update` before proceeding. |
| `pm_designer_engineer_decision` | PASS | With_skill routes through PM discovery, records that PM artifacts remain pending, requests confirmation of platform/current-page constraints, and proposes producing the UI solution before any frontend implementation; this distinguishes the PM/design path from Engineer execution. |
| `implementation_waits_for_alignment` | PASS | With_skill explicitly states `confirmation_required: 是` and `暂不进入代码实现`; delivery evidence shows no files, diffs, commits, or other mutations. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=136d33197196e1b7b76b45c28f0b7abb6c625c87369234374fc50d6d6b9a9beb; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Classifies the request as an existing update, keeps it in PM-led discovery pending confirmation, and defers implementation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=5c987ca5025338c8e10b8197002f5c926e1fd3757ea60bc1f9215a33ae1762ea; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a detailed UI proposal directly without PM/Designer/Engineer routing or explicit alignment gates.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
