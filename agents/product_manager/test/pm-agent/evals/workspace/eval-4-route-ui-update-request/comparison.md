## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_design_or_update` | PASS | The with_skill output explicitly classifies the request as `existing_update`. |
| `pm_designer_engineer_decision` | PASS | It routes to `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, requires product-scope confirmation, and explicitly defers design and code, distinguishing PM work from Designer and Engineer work. |
| `implementation_waits_for_alignment` | NOT_EXERCISED | It sets an execution boundary of no design/code/test and requires confirmation, but later alignment and Engineer handoff are not present in the locked evidence. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=71187b8981979ecc0ff1c6c3a141409f1dccb4dea8f92b2e9b45c7fb57004349; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Routes the UI request to PM discovery, asks for scope confirmation, and stops before design or implementation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=9e5b1e7f2515bc15b38c0e4857b7221e922971d6f2256cd9de7354a215ebfd00; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a detailed UI proposal immediately without the required routing and alignment gate.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Confirm the primary user problem before producing aligned artifacts and handing off implementation.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
