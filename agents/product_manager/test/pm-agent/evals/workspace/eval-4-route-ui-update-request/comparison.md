## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_design_or_update` | PASS | The with_skill output routes the request to an `existing-project-update` lane rather than directly implementing it, which semantically satisfies the required UI-update classification. |
| `pm_designer_engineer_decision` | PASS | It identifies the work as an interface/interaction decision requiring PRD/DECISIONS artifacts before implementation, distinguishing the product/design phase from later engineering execution. |
| `implementation_waits_for_alignment` | NOT_EXERCISED | The workflow pauses for user confirmation of the interaction model before artifact completion or engineering handoff, so the later alignment-gated implementation step is not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=f158d22f844cb6339cd662fc8ab61833a4f48382fb4323518f777880eeff32e4; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Classifies the request as an existing-project UI update, establishes product/design decisions and durable documentation as prerequisites, and pauses for confirmation before implementation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=0e6b915f384d444d2d01a85e4ad2b67cec3ce54ae3b1f9b07c277b081cf6222b; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a generic settings-page design directly without explicit request-type or role-path classification.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Confirm the interaction model, then complete the aligned PM/design artifacts and hand off to engineering if implementation is approved.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
