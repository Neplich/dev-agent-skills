## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_design_or_update` | PASS | With_skill explicitly classifies the request as `request_type: existing_update`, routes it through `pm-agent` and `idea-to-spec`, and does not implement code. |
| `pm_designer_engineer_decision` | PASS | With_skill explicitly uses the PM route, identifies design and engineering impacts as pending, and keeps the work in discovery pending confirmation rather than handing off implementation. |
| `implementation_waits_for_alignment` | NOT_EXERCISED | No Engineer handoff or implementation occurred. The workflow correctly pauses for user confirmation, so the later alignment gate is not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=aec9ff445a1a3d33daa44fc84e3315f05bc4208b868f1053675503a13636d1d5; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the UI request as an existing update, routed it through PM and idea-to-spec discovery, and paused for confirmation before downstream work.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=cc5c00e0814501d7ed50a7f0170322a995f768ddcee0b14ac461aa95868c10b8; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=99bc864a02bf778897890f2c80c945b8fc4a72312222783f784082eaafdabe5a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provided a generic UI proposal without explicit request classification or PM/Designer/Engineer routing, while making no code changes.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Confirm the preferred left-navigation pattern, then complete the applicable PM/design alignment before any Engineer implementation handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
