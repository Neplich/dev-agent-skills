## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routes_to_structure_governance` | PASS | Raw trace records selection of `idea-to-spec:structure-governance` as the PM specialist route. |
| `read_only_audit` | PASS | Candidate output states the audit was read-only; git evidence shows unchanged HEAD, branch, status, and diffs. |
| `report_form` | PASS | Raw trace proves an HTML report was written under `/tmp/structure-governance.7BCSp7/`, verified its size, and showed clean git status; output provides a summary and report link. |
| `scope_six_role_dirs` | PASS | Raw trace scans all six required roots and the report records the four missing role roots as coverage limitations. |
| `structural_change_requires_confirmation` | PASS | Report and trace state no structural change was executed; future move/split operations require confirmation and `change_tier: major`. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=78a9ed4a2ff6af194b93c81277958547f5a87533a70b2aa14e43822f139e54d3; fixture_sha256=1a6d7fa4c22a394f3c854eef7a25f4d0cf2e6b4ecd7c7a3d3bf15d295d6e43f8; output_sha256=dab979c4e20d389443772979825d24e937f95c9c37c66c4a3e3d3954e9cef490; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routed and completed a read-only six-role structure audit, produced the runtime HTML report, and preserved the repository unchanged.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=78a9ed4a2ff6af194b93c81277958547f5a87533a70b2aa14e43822f139e54d3; fixture_sha256=1a6d7fa4c22a394f3c854eef7a25f4d0cf2e6b4ecd7c7a3d3bf15d295d6e43f8; output_sha256=9560ebdbea487676678c5228957740782c0b06e52a2d1a76c7f817aa45f048ec; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline inspected only PM and Engineer content, omitted the required six-role scope and runtime HTML report, and did not use the structure-governance route.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
