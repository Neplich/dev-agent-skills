## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routes_to_structure_governance` | PASS | With-skill routing explicitly selects pm-agent:idea-to-spec:structure-governance. |
| `read_only_audit` | PASS | The output declares a read-only boundary; locked trace shows no repository changes, and git evidence is unchanged. |
| `report_form` | PASS | Locked trace shows HTML creation and validation in /tmp outside the repository; the response also provides a conclusion summary. |
| `scope_six_role_dirs` | PASS | The report and trace enumerate all six role roots, identifying missing Design, QA, DevOps, and Security roots as coverage limitations. |
| `structural_change_requires_confirmation` | PASS | The report performs no structural action and states future approved structural implementation must be a major change after confirmation. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=78a9ed4a2ff6af194b93c81277958547f5a87533a70b2aa14e43822f139e54d3; fixture_sha256=1a6d7fa4c22a394f3c854eef7a25f4d0cf2e6b4ecd7c7a3d3bf15d295d6e43f8; output_sha256=51be86bb7d3ec6ad6a558db4682d62e436a94dc6b2757ecc3ca97eff8010c6b8; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Routes to structure governance, performs a read-only six-role audit, produces and validates an external HTML report, and preserves confirmation boundaries for structural changes.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=78a9ed4a2ff6af194b93c81277958547f5a87533a70b2aa14e43822f139e54d3; fixture_sha256=1a6d7fa4c22a394f3c854eef7a25f4d0cf2e6b4ecd7c7a3d3bf15d295d6e43f8; output_sha256=44aa7652dab047b072e6f187c50b6ca0c6d494a039dd05148e6cd23c445c010b; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a fresh baseline audit of only the two present role directories and does not produce the required governance routing or HTML report.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
