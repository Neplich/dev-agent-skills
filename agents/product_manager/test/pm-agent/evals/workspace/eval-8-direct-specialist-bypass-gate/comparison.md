## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With-skill output begins with a complete `Routing decision`, selects `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, identifies unresolved scope, and states the execution boundary. |
| `requires_product_and_engineering_basis` | NOT_EXERCISED | The candidate correctly remains in greenfield discovery and requires product confirmation before PRD/DECISIONS and downstream engineering work; the later PRD/TRD gate is not exercised because user confirmation is pending. |
| `blocks_implementation` | PASS | The output explicitly prohibits implementation, tests, and technical design, and no delivery snapshot or mutation is present in the with-skill lane. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=2bf92ab490b9b41ae4685bfc0d239d31333c5a2cd9e7f229bcec5eef0acd4df0; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Routes the underspecified feature to PM discovery, asks for the first product decision, and blocks implementation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=7cf87eba5057dd98573fd48a80b2fd258b5974c52f4886265333a0fc9ae7db9f; snapshot_sha256=903a04e2e78066f2b1858958b89191c5d17683fc5ddf8466321da87a0ff7f449
- Behavior: Immediately created an implementation plan, code, and tests despite missing product and technical scope.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
