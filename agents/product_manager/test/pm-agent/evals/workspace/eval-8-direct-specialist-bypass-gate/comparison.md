## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With-skill output provides a Routing decision, classifies the request as a new feature with undefined scope, selects idea-to-spec, records entry_basis as missing, and sets an execution boundary that blocks implementation. |
| `requires_product_and_engineering_basis` | PASS | With-skill output identifies missing users, MVP, acceptance criteria, PRD/DECISIONS, technical design, and confirmed scope, and requires clarification before downstream work. |
| `blocks_implementation` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly prohibits implementation plans, code, tests, and technical design; locked git evidence shows no workspace changes. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=e2b5b45fe5cd7aa9b850199e91c2b87b8fa48383c75ab615dd9775e0e910c306; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Routes the vague request into PM discovery, asks a focused clarification question, and blocks downstream implementation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=cd89d65cb3681b4dcf6c1b550aa862e49fea9a2f1c0b847192b6475754ec45f8; snapshot_sha256=e4a352604a38885ddb7f0506a1f0b197f907f7733cf35bc717b4b79260e28a63
- Behavior: Immediately created an implementation plan, code, and tests despite missing product and engineering basis.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
