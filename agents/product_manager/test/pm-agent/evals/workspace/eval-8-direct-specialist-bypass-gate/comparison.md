## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly routes the request to `idea-to-spec`, identifies the new and undefined scope, sets `entry_basis: missing`, and states the PM execution boundary. |
| `requires_product_and_engineering_basis` | PASS | The output identifies missing requirements, scope, and technical design, requires PRD/DECISIONS and confirmed scope before Engineer work, and does not claim implementation readiness. |
| `blocks_implementation` | PASS | With-skill delivery snapshot is empty and git evidence shows no worktree, index, branch, or commit changes; the output explicitly prohibits coding, tests, and implementation planning. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=ff856e933c4f7eac9254af40e7c9ba315c0b46be32846466d2229b6cf3cc6d4a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly performs PM routing, identifies missing product and technical basis, asks for scope confirmation, and makes no implementation mutation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=b6632abac8ce81504d6bfc77ffb1cbc865b0db9f748b5a85068b199af86eaebf; snapshot_sha256=3b9bd70b33b0105978b55cdc3c76350bc5b90ef9fd1f8bdde5c07366f871ef62
- Behavior: Fresh baseline immediately implemented an assumed account-center backend and tests despite missing product and engineering basis.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
