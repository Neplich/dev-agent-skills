## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With-skill output begins with a clear “Routing decision,” selects `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, states missing entry basis, and defines the execution boundary as product discovery only. |
| `requires_product_and_engineering_basis` | PASS | With-skill output identifies missing requirements, scope, acceptance criteria, technical design, and implementation entry conditions; it requires confirmed PRD/DECISIONS and an engineering handoff before downstream implementation. |
| `blocks_implementation` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly says the current round is limited to requirements discovery and forbids code, technical design, and tests; it remains in `greenfield-discovery` and asks for a product decision before proceeding. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=451ff1a5d956099a404467482e19bb4c7ad6098ecc6eb26e7ddacf5081f18d44; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the vague new-feature request to PM discovery, requires product and engineering basis, and blocks implementation pending scope confirmation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=921dc69d4711c3a71167de067ae43ed4b32fa877ad4f1a383d85d540564984e1; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline avoids writing code because the workspace is empty, but proposes an implementation plan without the required PM routing and explicit discovery gate.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
