## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With-skill output begins with an explicit Routing decision, selects pm-agent:idea-to-spec, marks entry_basis as missing, and states an execution boundary that permits clarification but forbids implementation. |
| `requires_product_and_engineering_basis` | NOT_EXERCISED | The candidate correctly remains before implementation planning and requests missing product clarification; the later PRD/technical-design gate cannot yet be exercised without user confirmation. |
| `blocks_implementation` | PASS | The output explicitly forbids code, tests, and engineering implementation, keeps the lane at greenfield-discovery, and locked git evidence shows no workspace changes. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=33e40c45274e9375b3d10767417a25a2a496587ecfd7f7783b692727056a3f7c; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Routes the vague feature request to PM discovery, asks for clarification, and performs no implementation mutation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=827e1eab57730473669ffa6562263ebb5fcf35595b38ae224272aca2a629a167; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=6ddaea24e25c908cae105c6346a1fb4914387c4632386763c11460ceb01bfa64; snapshot_sha256=3a45d5ea5e8182d269707117ed02b2d47a95a164a6f7899f8ffb1f00c6f42def
- Behavior: Immediately implemented an assumed profile feature with a plan, code, and tests despite unresolved scope.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: After user confirmation, verify PRD or equivalent product expectations, TRD or equivalent technical design, and confirmed implementation scope before any implementation plan.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
