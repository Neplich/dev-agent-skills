## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `detect_missing_target` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states that designer-agent or equivalent design capability is unavailable. |
| `mark_handoff_blocked` | PASS | With-skill output sets entry_basis to blocked, lists the unavailable designer-agent capability as a blocker, and says to install/enable it. |
| `do_not_perform_missing_role` | PASS | With-skill output states no files were modified, prohibits design/implementation/planning/testing beyond PM scope, and provides only a PM routing/blocker packet. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=5230fc275f473a55b5d59c172358aff82cf42415f36da1a920c1b4fa1e1e3cc1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=9183afd437787ea84c638d9aa97d16f86d52744492739e105c28f851da98728b; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly identified the unavailable designer-agent, marked the handoff blocked, named the required capability, and stopped at the PM boundary without producing design deliverables.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=5230fc275f473a55b5d59c172358aff82cf42415f36da1a920c1b4fa1e1e3cc1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=52e534e35e5f09f5a3be95538e8a832a1ce66b396f15887e2a99b79cae6e008d; snapshot_sha256=6f95a797188bf1e8c9eff71450abec3e30107d6c8b41f9ecab69394080e88df4
- Behavior: Created a settings-page design handoff document and performed design-spec work despite the unavailable design capability.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
