## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `detect_missing_target` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states that `designer-agent` is unavailable/not installed. |
| `mark_handoff_blocked` | PASS | With-skill output marks `entry_basis: blocked`, identifies the handoff as unable to complete, and says to install/enable `designer-agent`. |
| `do_not_perform_missing_role` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states `PM 不代替 Designer 执行设计` and produces no visual specifications or design deliverables. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=5230fc275f473a55b5d59c172358aff82cf42415f36da1a920c1b4fa1e1e3cc1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=f8ee58d2aceae8da129178334c39232481893fb1721c411954f22b0d2385e72c; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly detects the missing designer capability, marks the handoff blocked, names the required capability, and preserves the PM/Designer boundary without performing design work.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=5230fc275f473a55b5d59c172358aff82cf42415f36da1a920c1b4fa1e1e3cc1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=569f28dc8527c02c3012cdcc541ff535f8e08b551297b68afaa1810cf19f388f; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a generic request for missing project inputs and does not identify the unavailable designer-agent or mark the handoff blocked.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
