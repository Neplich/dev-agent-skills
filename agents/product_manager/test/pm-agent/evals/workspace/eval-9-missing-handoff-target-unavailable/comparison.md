## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `detect_missing_target` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly states that `designer-agent` is unavailable and not installed. |
| `mark_handoff_blocked` | PASS | With_skill output sets `entry_basis: blocked`, states the entry gate failed, and instructs enabling or installing `designer-agent`. |
| `do_not_perform_missing_role` | PASS | With_skill output limits PM to routing and handoff, explicitly prohibits substituting for Designer, and produces no visual design deliverable. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=5230fc275f473a55b5d59c172358aff82cf42415f36da1a920c1b4fa1e1e3cc1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=f69cabbe5990ebe0acf32a764e24de015503e2ba1986b3d42451cff87e667a3f; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly identifies the unavailable Designer target, marks the handoff blocked, provides a PM handoff, and preserves the role boundary.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=5230fc275f473a55b5d59c172358aff82cf42415f36da1a920c1b4fa1e1e3cc1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=6eb1c3e1f1301370bf7cc25db1bf2423a6fd22719a70084f6bd43fe18e6a364d; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline inspected the empty workspace and requested missing requirements, but did not identify the unavailable designer-agent or mark the handoff blocked.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
