## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_bug_report` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly sets request_type: bug_report and blocks repair. |
| `expectation_first` | NOT_EXERCISED | No approved PRD/TRD or equivalent expectation source exists in the locked fixture; the lane correctly records this blocker, so expectation confirmation was not exercisable. |
| `debugger_handoff_after_confirmation` | NOT_EXERCISED | Because expectation confirmation was blocked, no Engineer/debugger handoff occurred; this later step was not exercisable. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3622b3dfdb9bef50766ff22e70a5639483865b84fa39f8a64f027bc492debda1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=a879b9c34597f930ceb335ee616ceb180770ed887d5f9a3cdd442b0bc6a2c545; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Classified the request as bug_report, identified missing evidence, and safely stopped without mutation or premature handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3622b3dfdb9bef50766ff22e70a5639483865b84fa39f8a64f027bc492debda1; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=426844a3b9120a04f56adbd306fda2cb7057d12bdb9b1c4c5f9a03a1ce7ed5b9; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Inspected the empty workspace and stopped without classification or expectation-first routing.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the application workspace and approved expectation documents, then confirm the expectation before handing off to Engineer/debugger.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
