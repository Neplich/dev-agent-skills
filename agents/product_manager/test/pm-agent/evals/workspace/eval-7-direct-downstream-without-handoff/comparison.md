## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With_skill output begins with a clear Routing decision and includes request_type, selected_owner, entry_basis, feature_path, and execution_boundary. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | With_skill routes to pm-agent:idea-to-spec, identifies unresolved scope and missing materials, states no Engineer handoff is available, and keeps engineering blocked. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | With_skill states that product/design/source context is missing, calls for scope and acceptance confirmation plus PRD/DECISIONS or equivalent implementation basis, and explicitly sets the boundary to not modify code. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=81a850a508b1ba105866f8018f96d1845ccb43d24f0d6ce8ebdf62f52dffd3a6; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the request through PM, preserves the idea-to-spec boundary, and blocks code changes pending product, design, and implementation evidence.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=b60148720d69f63126cee14595b5b8e32862b786fea50cb87351447e089a90c7; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reports that the empty repository prevents implementation; it does not provide the required PM routing or evidence-based engineering boundary.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
