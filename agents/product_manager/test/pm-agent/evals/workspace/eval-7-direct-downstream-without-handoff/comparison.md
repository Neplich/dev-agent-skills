## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With_skill output begins with a Routing decision and includes request_type, selected_owner, entry_basis, feature_path, and execution_boundary. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | With_skill keeps the work with pm-agent:idea-to-spec, states no handoff packet exists, and explicitly limits execution to PM routing and read-only checks. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | With_skill identifies missing product/design/code context, requires further scope and implementation input, and locked git evidence shows no file or repository mutation. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=e4d407b5eb0b55685eb4d6867fa37f8061e85b04404a22ea878921b46a837383; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the request to PM discovery, maintains PM scope, and blocks engineering execution pending sufficient basis; no mutations occurred.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=00ce9ad6c69412ada04bc918058187ce6cdcc17152be51b4d5a7c2d592c44426; snapshot_sha256=6f57084a4291c980a02fc6ddf0b239435863080dbf23d6dd353c5467418749c8
- Behavior: Fresh baseline implemented a standalone settings page and created untracked files without the required PM routing or execution boundary.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
