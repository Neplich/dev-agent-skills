## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With-skill output begins with a labeled Routing decision and includes request_type, selected_owner, entry_basis, feature_path, and execution_boundary. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | With-skill output keeps the work in the idea-to-spec path, marks feature_path unresolved, provides no handoff packet, and does not claim Engineer handoff or downstream execution. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | With-skill output identifies missing product, design, and implementation basis, requires further scope/context confirmation, and locked git evidence shows no changes or commits. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=b7d110ed82c94c517491ee072fd0a7baf9064fcf24b6f435a66ee7937d867e0a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provided the required PM routing decision, stayed in idea-to-spec alignment, and blocked implementation pending missing evidence.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=b17b2d23697eac6a8a90976c53ca85456f56195834b24e19221450d565b4570f; snapshot_sha256=a1273a0cddd53bcd621b3c17848d1c796777a81199bd74268225d1a3af40236e
- Behavior: Implemented and delivered new settings-page files without the required routing or evidence gates.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
