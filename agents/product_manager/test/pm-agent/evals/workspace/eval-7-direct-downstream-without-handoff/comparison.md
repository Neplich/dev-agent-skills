## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With-skill output provides an auditable routing decision with selected_owner `idea-to-spec`, blocked entry_basis, unresolved feature_path, and an explicit execution boundary. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | With-skill output keeps the request in PM/idea-to-spec discovery, states the project is empty and blocked, and does not claim an Engineer handoff or downstream execution. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | With-skill output requires product scope, design materials, and existing implementation/code or layout basis before proceeding, and explicitly prohibits writing code. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=a9b3dbe3e3cdc4bde676128a1cebfa75f23e59859424ed8dba8daae1037e0dc0; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routed the request to PM discovery, identified missing basis, and blocked implementation without modifying code.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=2b400a645dfce3cae65dfe0f7a27ab340cfa6f225a071ff27642c41f0cfd065a; snapshot_sha256=df30d332dc7c1cb669534c43b47f952e575933dc964041c74ce5db24956ada0f
- Behavior: Fresh baseline directly implemented a static settings page despite missing product/design basis.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
