## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keeps_pm_alignment` | PASS | With_skill explicitly routes to PM / idea-to-spec, marks entry blocked, and states Engineer implementation cannot safely begin. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | With_skill records unresolved feature_path, empty source documents, blocked PM entry, and no Engineer handoff or downstream execution. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | With_skill requests confirmation of the repository and minimum layout requirements, identifies missing PRD/decision/design/technical basis, and locked git evidence shows no code changes. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=96767d422ff07d700fd48e4ad867b623e84b20cf20dd8a296149fa1729eaea0e; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Stayed in PM idea-to-spec alignment, identified missing scope and evidence, blocked engineering, and made no changes.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=0bfcff02c8ffb5f50c0ad74d697794d1bef6c4e413e21faaa78c117e35820659; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reported the empty repository and did not establish the PM alignment or evidence-gating rationale.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Confirm the correct repository and minimum layout requirements, then establish the required product, design, and implementation basis before engineering handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
