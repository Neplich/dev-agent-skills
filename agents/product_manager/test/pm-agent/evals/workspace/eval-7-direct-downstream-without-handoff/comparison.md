## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keeps_pm_alignment` | PASS | with_skill output routes the request to PM / idea-to-spec with entry_basis: blocked, unresolved feature_path, and no claim of Engineer handoff or implementation. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | with_skill output explicitly identifies PM / idea-to-spec as selected owner, leaves feature_path unresolved, and states no downstream handoff evidence exists. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | with_skill output identifies missing product/design materials, unresolved scope and technical stack, requires confirming the target layout, and locked git evidence shows no code changes. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=3b23d5c4860efe84cc0eb45f7f203f98d7104dbc2b396370d5ebbdd91d8dd071; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Stayed in PM idea-to-spec alignment, blocked engineering, requested missing scope and evidence, and made no code changes.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=c92e6ad49e5053335487697dd392f72cd6111e448a58706ce691e566713b1e68; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reported the empty repository and inability to modify the layout; it did not establish PM alignment or the evidence gate.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
