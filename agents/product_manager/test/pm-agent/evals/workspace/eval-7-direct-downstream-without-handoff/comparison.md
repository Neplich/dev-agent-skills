## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With_skill output begins with a clear Routing decision containing request_type, selected_owner, entry_basis, feature_path, and execution_boundary. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | With_skill routes to pm-agent:idea-to-spec, marks feature_path unresolved, states no downstream execution or Engineer handoff, and keeps the work at scope alignment. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | With_skill identifies missing product/design/source context, unresolved layout scope and acceptance criteria, requires a minimum implementation scope before Engineer handoff, and locked git evidence shows no code changes. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=4b42a9fbaf3f9640eb28f95f942aad49debd6763dbaedb65320388c1effc3e7f; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides the required PM routing decision, preserves idea-to-spec alignment, blocks engineering pending product/design/implementation basis, and makes no mutations.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=a1d94655125d65bac1ce137143002862881573e96377683c76f656421f84e722; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reports that the workspace lacks source files and does not provide the required PM routing decision or scope-alignment rationale.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
