## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing_decision_present` | PASS | With_skill output provides an auditable route to idea-to-spec, identifies it as selected_owner, and records entry_basis, feature_path, and execution_boundary in the routing block. |
| `stay_in_pm_alignment` | PASS | With_skill output keeps the request in the PM idea-to-spec path, states that product/design scope is unresolved, and explicitly prohibits Engineer handoff or downstream execution. |
| `blocks_engineering_without_basis` | PASS | With_skill output identifies missing product, design, and technical evidence, requires confirmation before implementation, and explicitly prohibits direct code changes; git evidence confirms no changes. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=404f49526f6d15f29fc9631300853f820c741b83122368bbb21da3491c1d59e8; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routed the request to PM/idea-to-spec, maintained the scope-alignment boundary, blocked implementation pending required evidence, and requested user confirmation for the next clarification step.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=57e82609f413c88720ec90ed64877ede694585115e55bf0256d08e8274436d4f; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=960b7470019352e91d31da7edc6269201bb79413a26afb843045e66346f8ebbc; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Recognized the empty repository and avoided mutation, but did not provide the required PM routing decision or scope-alignment gate.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
