## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route_to_idea_to_spec` | PASS | with_skill explicitly selects `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, keeps `feature_path: unresolved`, and enters `greenfield-discovery`. |
| `pm_first_guardrail` | PASS | with_skill identifies `project_status: empty`, preserves PM-first boundaries, and explicitly forbids coding, technical implementation, and testing. |
| `context_to_collect` | PASS | with_skill asks the highest-information first question about the primary user and task, with concrete answer options. |
| `expected_pm_artifacts` | NOT_EXERCISED | The response remains in discovery and states that PRD/DECISIONS are pending until confirmation; no PM artifact or handoff is produced yet. |
| `handoff_boundary` | NOT_EXERCISED | No handoff occurs in this turn; the workflow correctly pauses for the user's answer. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=4bb8c2c37a57f8f3e1e7d8709d66b2af777eb44d21b9a665107d16cce7d41d97; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the empty-directory product idea through PM greenfield discovery, avoids implementation, and asks a focused first discovery question.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=2c8f8efbcb2dbb4fe33da832583e24dd5aa284f3f5250c0ef9dbc2c34fc1a168; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides premature product scope and implementation-oriented planning before confirming target user and core problem.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Await the user's answer to the first product-discovery question before producing PRD/DECISIONS or considering handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
