## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route_to_idea_to_spec` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly selects `idea-to-spec` and `greenfield-discovery`, with product discovery as the next action and no engineering handoff. |
| `pm_first_guardrail` | PASS | It identifies the project as empty, requires confirmation, and sets the execution boundary to product discovery and scope refinement without coding. |
| `context_to_collect` | PASS | It asks the highest-value first discovery question about the target user, offering three concrete options and inviting a custom answer. |
| `expected_pm_artifacts` | NOT_EXERCISED | The lane is still waiting for the user's answer to the first discovery question; no PM document is claimed as completed or handed off. |
| `handoff_boundary` | NOT_EXERCISED | No handoff occurs in this turn; the output remains within PM discovery. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=6e0bebfd295005fd58dbccedd5699830fc4341332fddea3806e5d775e8be1bb5; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly stayed in the greenfield PM discovery route, established the empty-directory guardrail, and asked a focused target-user question without mutations or handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=cf3dd8f5c043c4bb2376e76f8a6a8eae6e4fdcf372ea49af00e5223c69577b83; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Also stayed PM-first and avoided coding, but proposed substantial product scope and multiple decisions before asking for focused user context.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Obtain the user's answer to the target-user question, then continue product discovery and later produce confirmed PM artifacts before any handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
