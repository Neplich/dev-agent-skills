## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route_to_idea_to_spec` | PASS | With_skill explicitly selects `idea-to-spec` and `greenfield-discovery`, keeps the feature path unresolved, and states it will not enter design, engineering, or testing. |
| `pm_first_guardrail` | PASS | With_skill identifies `project_status: empty`, frames the request as product discovery, and explicitly says not to write code or create formal documents yet. |
| `context_to_collect` | PASS | With_skill asks the highest-information first discovery question: who the assistant primarily serves, with user-segment options tied to core scenarios. |
| `expected_pm_artifacts` | NOT_EXERCISED | The interaction is still waiting for the user's answer to the first discovery question; no discovery-complete claim or handoff occurred, so PM artifacts are not yet exercised. |
| `handoff_boundary` | NOT_EXERCISED | Only the first discovery question was asked and no handoff occurred, so the later handoff boundary is not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=2bf1fbdac04c9747c43b474e894f52acf3b598026022db54d6babbcb021c134f; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Routes the empty-directory product idea through PM and idea-to-spec discovery, asks a focused user-segment question, and preserves the no-code boundary.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=6b3bd5fce4da3cbf7a571053e7793c8d08faebe852f820e1639d5a0af568c41a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides an extensive premature MVP/design proposal and asks several follow-up questions, without first narrowing the product through a PM discovery route.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Continue discovery after the user answers the target-user question; then produce PRD/decision artifacts only once the required scope is confirmed.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
