## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route_to_idea_to_spec` | PASS | With-skill output selects `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, identifies greenfield discovery, and keeps the feature path unresolved without engineering execution. |
| `pm_first_guardrail` | PASS | It identifies the project as empty, preserves PM-first scope discovery, and explicitly prohibits code and technical implementation. |
| `context_to_collect` | PASS | It asks which users and core problem the first version serves, with focused options and an invitation to clarify. |
| `expected_pm_artifacts` | NOT_EXERCISED | The interaction is still awaiting the user's answer to the first discovery question; no PM completion or handoff is claimed. |
| `handoff_boundary` | NOT_EXERCISED | No handoff occurs in this turn; the candidate remains in discovery and requests user input. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=7846da523e42fa7f3730bffbeeb10cdbfc23a65bd99d403bb4334c866685f09d; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the empty-directory product idea to PM idea-to-spec, establishes the PM-first boundary, and asks a high-information discovery question.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=4716c9fa33dcfe9f6036cb418b55b79561f411bdc4955c38d2266bbce2349253; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a reasonable MVP proposal and asks several product questions, but does not explicitly establish the required PM route or structured discovery boundary.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Await the user's answer before assessing PM artifacts or handoff behavior.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
