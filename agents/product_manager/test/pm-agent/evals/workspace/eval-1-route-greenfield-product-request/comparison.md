## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route_to_idea_to_spec` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states it entered `idea-to-spec` and `greenfield-discovery`, with product-definition work as the current output and no engineering execution. |
| `pm_first_guardrail` | PASS | It identifies the workspace as an empty directory/new feature, keeps the work in PM discovery, and explicitly defers code, technical selection, and formal implementation. |
| `context_to_collect` | PASS | It asks a high-information discovery question about the target user/use case and offers concrete user categories, while inviting the user to describe the context. |
| `expected_pm_artifacts` | NOT_EXERCISED | The lane is explicitly waiting for the user's answer to the first discovery question and has no delivered PM artifacts, so this assertion is not exercised. |
| `handoff_boundary` | NOT_EXERCISED | No handoff occurs; the candidate remains in discovery awaiting clarification, so the later handoff boundary is not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=c0bc09ad697450aa2ec776d6696879e71412f246249e73a072e0cdd9404f9632; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Stayed in greenfield PM discovery, identified the empty-directory context, deferred implementation, and asked the first product-discovery question.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=acfb6edf3aff0b94988c5e9a7ff435967801458a79c851afd902400163536b81; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=e08b8d9dad7ca44ea0a9d82835bd6ba6b90d13cb09a68b13db0fca51f72f56f6; snapshot_sha256=71caad971fa4e71bb31925076eb8462b195754f155010a7f081e48deb682f0c5
- Behavior: Produced PRODUCT_PLAN and DECISIONS artifacts and declared the project ready for design/development before resolving the initial product-discovery question.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Collect the user's answer to the target-user/core-use-case question, then continue scope and acceptance-criteria discovery before producing PM artifacts or handing off.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
