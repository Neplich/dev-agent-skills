## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_validation` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sets `request_type: validation`. |
| `test_basis_first` | NOT_EXERCISED | The candidate verified that no PRD, TRD, implementation plan, acceptance standard, or other test-basis document was available, so confirmation of a usable basis could not be exercised. |
| `qa_or_test_writer_handoff` | NOT_EXERCISED | The candidate correctly blocked downstream handoff because the expected behavior and source documents were unavailable; a QA/test-writer handoff could not yet occur. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=4218f10d3ed4e9cd371593f2189a2a839bc274fdd0a0cfb5ca1bd0ee76ec171e; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Classified the request as validation and stopped safely pending the missing project context and testing basis.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=21273853863991985530f7af7a97e3136e2ba9f2bc0336a2db90ebdd33c74bf8; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Reported the empty repository and stopped without classifying the request or establishing a validation route.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the correct project workspace and a PRD, TRD, implementation plan, or existing acceptance record before continuing to test planning or handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
