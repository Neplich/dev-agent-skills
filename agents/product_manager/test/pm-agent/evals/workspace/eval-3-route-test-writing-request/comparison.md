Overall result: PASS (partial coverage)

## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_validation` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly classifies `request_type` as `validation`. |
| `test_basis_first` | PASS | It explicitly records `entry_basis: missing`, identifies the absent PRD/TRD/acceptance evidence, and stops without inventing a testing basis. |
| `qa_or_test_writer_handoff` | NOT_EXERCISED | No handoff occurs because the testing basis and runtime/project evidence are missing; the later handoff condition is therefore not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=6b1631ffdbc50a144b9949e46e0347122a867bd2dcf1e6a0351b77612df2d904; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the request as validation, checks and reports missing test basis and project evidence, and refuses downstream execution.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=28a745bbaf54580b00803e0f6c00fec20b105e4f099c03bba441bd45578bce0a; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reports an empty workspace and cannot classify or route the request.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the project code and PRD/TRD/implementation or acceptance evidence, then reassess the handoff condition.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
