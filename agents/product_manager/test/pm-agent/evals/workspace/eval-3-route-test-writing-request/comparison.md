## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_validation` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly classifies the request as `request_type: validation`. |
| `test_basis_first` | NOT_EXERCISED | The lane reports `entry_basis: blocked` and `source_documents: []`; no PRD, TRD, implementation plan, or acceptance record was available to confirm as the test basis. |
| `qa_or_test_writer_handoff` | NOT_EXERCISED | The lane correctly stops pending confirmed expectations and source documents, so a QA/test-writer handoff cannot yet occur. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=d33cce63167d48af6832c1200e64fb0a82aff393210d915fc2e27934e78607f7; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the request as validation, identifies missing project and test-basis evidence, and stops without making unsupported changes or handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=b953bfddd6e51c1963465b4c6fe67a5fea47ae8e9f423c50a05329a17e42d723; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reports an empty repository and cannot proceed; it does not classify the request or establish the validation workflow.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the correct project workspace and a confirmed PRD, TRD, implementation plan, or acceptance record, then resume QA/test-writer handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
