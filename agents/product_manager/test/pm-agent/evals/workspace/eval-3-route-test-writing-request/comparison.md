## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_validation` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly classifies the request as `validation` and routes it toward QA validation. |
| `test_basis_first` | PASS | With-skill output records `entry_basis: missing`, lists no source documents, identifies the missing PRD/TRD/acceptance basis, and blocks downstream test work until the basis is provided. |
| `qa_or_test_writer_handoff` | NOT_EXERCISED | No downstream handoff occurred because the required behavior basis was missing; the later handoff step therefore could not yet be exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=4bd30343171c1f0aa74cb7413f84b26c3a7960397d1507fda68f87840a1e33a0; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classifies the request, verifies that the required test basis is absent, and blocks downstream execution pending documentation and project code.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=376e61527b2a34a5473b42945f94774826f681202e0fb21dec24067f9b4377d8; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Detects the empty repository and stops, but does not provide the structured validation classification or basis-gated routing behavior.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the order/refund code and an approved PRD, TRD, implementation plan, or acceptance record, then perform the QA handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
