## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_type_validation` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly records `request_type: validation`, matching the required validation classification. |
| `test_basis_first` | PASS | With-skill output records `entry_basis: blocked`, an empty `source_documents` list, and explicitly states that PRD, TRD, DECISIONS, QA handoff documentation, and implementation evidence are unavailable; it gates test writing on obtaining confirmed expectations. |
| `qa_or_test_writer_handoff` | NOT_EXERCISED | No stable expectations or source documents were available, and the output explicitly defers QA handoff until PM supplies them; an actual QA/test-writer handoff was therefore not exercised. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=4b9b083faf5304d05b837018aa5cae53f6c96f151db36c783f2b675ed1ae6f8d; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as validation, checked for test-basis evidence, reported the missing prerequisites, and stopped before downstream test work or QA handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=3f7994fdecfb94451400a56972388597b7ae51d2d37508524058139c5273a4e3; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=d9ce4a72120ad9c5f8d0ffcab9c31f849fda9abb624076d177c2a232bb65b279; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Detected the empty repository and stopped, but did not provide the required validation classification or explicit test-basis/handoff gating.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the order-refund implementation and tests plus a PRD, TRD, confirmed implementation plan, or acceptance record.
- Next: After expectations are stable and source documents are named, hand off to QA or a test writer.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
