## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classify_standard` | PASS | with_skill output explicitly sets change_tier to standard and hotfix_disposition to rejected. |
| `require_prd_trd_alignment` | PASS | with_skill output requires confirmation of scope and approval boundaries, sets confirmation_required to true, and routes the next action to PM alignment before any Engineer handoff; no downstream implementation handoff occurs prematurely. |
| `request_type_existing_update` | PASS | with_skill output explicitly sets request_type to existing_update and explains the change as modifying the existing refund approval behavior. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=e005ea112e4284f52edcdfbe5e59c9f936284276e43a445b63d9c1c2ef0e5aa2; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as an existing project update with standard-tier change handling, rejected hotfix treatment, and gated downstream work on PM/product-boundary alignment. No files or repository state were modified.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=a28507a7542ad282cf771f598484f0e216141b5e11e524082d8ae2be995709f8; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Could not classify or route the product change; it only reported that the workspace was empty and requested a project directory.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
