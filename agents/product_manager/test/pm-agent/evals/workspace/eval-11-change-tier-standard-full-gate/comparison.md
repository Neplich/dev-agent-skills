## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classify_standard` | PASS | With_skill explicitly classifies the change as standard and rejects hotfix treatment. |
| `request_type_existing_update` | PASS | With_skill explicitly identifies the request as existing_update and explains that it changes existing refund-approval behavior. |
| `require_prd_trd_alignment` | NOT_EXERCISED | With_skill requires PM clarification and PRD/DECISIONS alignment, and forbids downstream implementation; the later downstream handoff is not exercised because user confirmation and project context are missing. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=15a17615ddad1b6fb98b191cc36ceae894a413e228c5fd6f1fda67b7871b4db2; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly routes the request as an existing standard business-rule update, gates implementation on product/document alignment, and requests the missing project context.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=7e332979d44ac05f36590316dc111549cb03b3a5482f6229066705e8d9e7781d; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reports that the workspace is empty and does not classify or route the request.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Obtain the target product/codebase and confirm the refund workflow and approval boundaries, then complete the PRD/TRD or equivalent alignment before any downstream implementation handoff.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
