## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classify_standard` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sets `change_tier: standard` and `hotfix_disposition: rejected`. |
| `require_prd_trd_alignment` | PASS | With-skill output requires PM scope alignment and updated PRD/DECISIONS before downstream implementation, and explicitly forbids modifying implementation, tests, or deployment at this stage. |
| `request_type_existing_update` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly sets `request_type: existing_update` and identifies the approved business-rule change. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=60a288e03db7017747a24a75e404b9af1a55dcf2b7762efdbcc1a35fc7108b29; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as an existing standard update, rejected hotfix treatment, and preserved the requirements-alignment gate before implementation handoff.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=1c8b4187d11d35f0e7a6c680c2043ba668d57ad06b75b07a8d5a1dc62281c317; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Reported the empty workspace and requested project context without classifying or routing the request.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
