## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classify_standard` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly states `change_tier: standard` and `hotfix_disposition: rejected`; the raw trace also confirms the standard classification before further work. |
| `require_prd_trd_alignment` | PASS | With_skill routes through `pm-agent:idea-to-spec`, requires confirmation of scope, PRD/DECISIONS changes, and engineering acceptance criteria, and explicitly defers implementation until the product and current-rule evidence is confirmed. |
| `request_type_existing_update` | PASS | With_skill output explicitly states `request_type: existing_update` and identifies the changed approved business behavior from automatic approval to administrator second confirmation. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=a2912910d621628d6de60ee0e17e2f312cd748036ba81e0930a565bbddf14d7f; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as an existing standard business-rule update, rejected hotfix treatment, and enforced product/engineering alignment before implementation.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=2c9f63eba393d7546f89112ce3f1659145dc2f6ca60bdba6ba71df10258a35a4; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=ba2ec8ddecb74b25f26b38a616df47d1546b94a059d516cfbd59b881c17a5411; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline only reported the empty repository and inability to modify code; it did not provide the required request classification or alignment gate.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
