## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocks_unknown_evidence` | PASS | With-skill output identifies the current CI and Helm evidence, treats access-note.md as historical, and records the DevOps-agent blocker without claiming integrated or ready deployment. |
| `builds_repo_wide_deployment_packet` | PASS | With-skill output includes request_type: deployment, N/A feature fields, empty feature_path_evidence, all source documents, and evidence-based blockers_risks. |
| `routes_devops_ordered_chain` | NOT_EXERCISED | The output routes the next step to DevOps, but the ordered downstream chain and final Docs synchronization cannot be exercised because the DevOps agent is unavailable. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=f6c9996daf9a7bdf78228fb674eccb457f386d1e74abf9925ac4646e4da1c9d4; fixture_sha256=16e3b6cbbbae6769ac6b5ead7bae34214b3dd90e3e6c4d5fad97cfd7d3784013; output_sha256=f190be631989ac8a5a75b51e93ec47e63da14b8e6461b9016c1a7c254d04bbd7; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Builds a repo-wide deployment handoff packet and routes the next step to DevOps while preserving authorization and evidence boundaries.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=f6c9996daf9a7bdf78228fb674eccb457f386d1e74abf9925ac4646e4da1c9d4; fixture_sha256=16e3b6cbbbae6769ac6b5ead7bae34214b3dd90e3e6c4d5fad97cfd7d3784013; output_sha256=e3d0c94465264e0f18e84c7285ad5f92032700eb5c272007e59911bf029f56a6; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Provides a prose planning recommendation focused on the public variant without producing the structured deployment handoff or ordered routing chain.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Provide the DevOps agent/runtime, then execute the ordered deployment-planner → cicd-bootstrap → env-config-auditor → formal-docs-sync chain.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
