## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classify_hotfix` | PASS | With_skill explicitly classifies the change tier as hotfix and states the unchanged approved scope and local verification basis. |
| `allow_fast_lane` | PASS | With_skill explicitly states fast_lane: allowed_after_classification, preserving the required ordering. |
| `preserve_evidence` | PASS | With_skill records confirmed scope, source_documents, local verification basis, and required targeted validation; it does not waive evidence because this is a hotfix. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=c8036aad85835ee733e12f58737233d7e9bc1a90da347bec50e7094cf58797ad; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=3d01f9de9c3f154bb8f7caa3942d149d00c6bdf60ad42d40804e26e38e811362; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classified the request as a hotfix, allowed fast-lane handling only after classification, and preserved scope/source/verification evidence while safely blocking delivery on the empty workspace and missing engineer-agent.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=c8036aad85835ee733e12f58737233d7e9bc1a90da347bec50e7094cf58797ad; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=55ffb59751dc09cc576f86aa362ab985eefc731868d15fdc3524d81932790983; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline failed to classify or route the request and only reported the empty workspace blocker.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
