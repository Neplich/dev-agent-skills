Overall result: PASS

## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classify_hotfix` | PASS | The with_skill output explicitly sets `change_tier: hotfix` and explains that the README-only link correction changes no functionality or approved expectations. |
| `allow_fast_lane` | PASS | The with_skill output sets `fast_lane: allowed_after_classification`, explicitly preserving the required ordering. |
| `preserve_evidence` | PASS | The with_skill output records confirmed scope, non-goals, source documents, and the user’s local link-opening confirmation; it also requires verification in the delivery output. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=c8036aad85835ee733e12f58737233d7e9bc1a90da347bec50e7094cf58797ad; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=22cb11d2dd713cb7adea5cef21be84be345bae255e90158f135c49a54593ac4d; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Correctly classifies the request as a hotfix, allows fast lane only after classification, preserves scope/source/verification evidence, and reports the delivery-agent blocker.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=c8036aad85835ee733e12f58737233d7e9bc1a90da347bec50e7094cf58797ad; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=90dba0aa687a79b2b94044775dc49fba5bfba17f5507c643123b9fb989b8fe22; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline reports inability to proceed and does not provide the requested classification or routing guidance.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: Install or enable engineer-agent, then execute the delivery handoff and verification.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
