## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `explicit_invocation_proceeds` | PASS | With-skill output explicitly states classification was completed, identifies the request as local file operation outside PM/downstream categories, and keeps it in PM without a scope-guard rejection. |
| `classifies_general_request` | PASS | With-skill output honestly states that no PM category or downstream role matches; it does not invent a request type or owner and does not skip classification. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=495fc0f825d65d1e7057e4dc84ea777d069a48dcb665a6ab231607b5f4f53d34; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=85e440b132673bfc7ff0492b789bc76defa98f87df5c995bdb5b6afa356a3b82; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Explicit pm-agent invocation proceeds to classification and honestly keeps the general file-operation request in PM.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=495fc0f825d65d1e7057e4dc84ea777d069a48dcb665a6ab231607b5f4f53d34; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=be9a0257816740672ca0afcade327f98a596a8b04dd01cb510243a55c1cb789c; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline stops because pm-agent and ~/Downloads are unavailable, without entering the required classification flow.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
