## Assertion Results

| Assertion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `explicit_invocation_proceeds` | PASS | with_skill explicitly used pm-agent, identified the request as outside PM/product-engineering scope, and honestly stopped without inventing a PM route or owner. |
| `classifies_general_request` | PASS | with_skill handled the general file-organization request through PM entry classification and honestly declared that no PM route applied; it did not skip classification to perform file operations. |

## With-Skill Behavior

- Run source: fresh with_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=495fc0f825d65d1e7057e4dc84ea777d069a48dcb665a6ab231607b5f4f53d34; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=ce0ae9c95932bc15d3b629aec9002c4ca36c86678c6dd758ad613d9b969206c9; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Honest PM classification: local file organization has no matching PM route, so execution stopped at the PM boundary.
- The with-skill context was created only after the baseline evidence was locked and destroyed.

## Fresh Without-Skill Baseline

- Run source: fresh without_skill candidate; model=gpt-5.6-luna; effort=medium; returncode=0; timed_out=False; prompt_sha256=495fc0f825d65d1e7057e4dc84ea777d069a48dcb665a6ab231607b5f4f53d34; fixture_sha256=44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a; output_sha256=7e4d9233ad8d09595773b0835bfddd1887e4305ff0b8b9de97dbcce70b84290f; snapshot_sha256=4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945
- Behavior: Fresh baseline reported pm-agent unavailable and stopped without PM classification.
- The baseline was generated fresh first, its output and delivery snapshot were locked, then its context was destroyed.

## Failures and Next Steps

- None.
- Next: None.

## Runtime Artifact Policy

- Candidate outputs, snapshots, judge packages, verdict payloads, timing, diagnostics, and other runtime files are deleted before the runner exits, including after FAIL, BLOCKED, or exceptions.
- This durable comparison retains only the latest reviewable conclusion; Git history preserves earlier revisions.
